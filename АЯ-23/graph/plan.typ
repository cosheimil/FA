Hello everyone! Today I will you the graph "Intel vs AMD (CPUs saled)". This plot illustrates info about quantity of some most popular CPUs in which company. We can see legendary Haswell, Sky lake architectures by Intel and Vishera by AMD.  \
Okay, the vertical axis shows us Number of CPUs saled. Horizontal axis represents years. Of course we can see dotted lines, but I wont describe theese lines at this moment. Today we will talk about red and blue solid lines. \
This graph starts at June of 2014th, I guess \
And in 2015th we can see first peak to AMD. But in the middle of 2015th Intel sales falled, because there factory in Israel had been broken before... And since this period to 2016 "Blue CPUs" sales are only growing. Unlike AMD CPUs maintains at the same level. \
Okay, let me show you the part between 2016 and 2017. This period is the best for Intel and the worst at the same time. Because in this period was the boom of cryptocurrency. And it seems to need of GPUs not CPUs, and sales are falling. After that was the peak of gaming and sales remain stable. AMD is still hid. \
But in the AMD introduced us a new chip. It was great, because it was a lot chipper than Intel, more perfomance. Unlike Intel sales dropped and still now are only decreasing. And AMD is growing rapidly. \
The graph clearly shows us that Intel was better than AMD before 2017. But later AMD is better than Intel. And now this comprassion stays same. \
If I build the PC now, I will buy AMD CPU only.
