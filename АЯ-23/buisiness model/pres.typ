  = Value Propositions. Specific original design

  We offer a dendrarium in the form of a "hanging garden". This design features a unique construction where plants are arranged on different levels inside a glass container, creating the impression of a floating green oasis. Such a design is visually appealing and takes up minimal space, making it ideal for use in small areas.

  _Automated watering_ and _lighting system_: The built-in automated watering and lighting system provides optimal conditions for plant growth inside the dendrarium. Sensors monitor soil moisture levels and illumination, automatically adjusting watering and lighting to ensure healthy plant growth.
